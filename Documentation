It will explain the purpose and features of the system, the interfaces of the system, what the system will do, the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system and will be proposed to the Faculty of Science for its approval.
1.2. Scope of Project
This software system will be a Web-Application System for the Faculty of Science. This system will be designed to maximize the productivity by providing tools to assist in automating the voting system review and publishing process, which would otherwise have to be performed manually. By maximizing the faculty registers work efficiency and production the system will meet the facultyâ€™s needs while remaining easy to understand and use.

More specifically, this system is designed to allow the faculty to manage and communicate with a group of Administrators, Dean and Lecturers  to vote on the website. The software will facilitate voting between Administrators, Dean and Lecturers using the web-application.
